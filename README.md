# Claudar

> Watch your Claude usage limits from the macOS menu bar, a desktop widget, and
> a status window — the same numbers as Claude Code's `/usage`, always in view.

> **Unofficial** — not affiliated with Anthropic. It reads *your* Claude sign-in
> from your Keychain, talks only to Anthropic's servers, and has no telemetry.

**Requires:** macOS 14+, an active Claude subscription, and the
[Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com) signed in.

## Install

**Homebrew** (recommended):

```sh
brew install --cask --no-quarantine jpuritz/tap/claudar
```

**Or** download `Claudar-menubar.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/jpuritz/Claudar/releases/latest),
unzip, drag **Claudar.app** to `/Applications`, then run once:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Claudar.app"
```

*(Both are needed because the app is ad-hoc signed; the flag / command tells
Gatekeeper to trust it.)*

**On first launch**, macOS asks to access *Claude Code-credentials* — click
**Always Allow**. That's how the app reads your usage.

> **Want the desktop widget?** The download and Homebrew builds are the **menu
> bar + window** version. The widget has to be built from source (free, needs
> Xcode) — see [building](docs/TECHNICAL.md#building-from-source).

## Features

- **Menu bar** — a colored ring and your 5-hour session percentage; click for
  every limit with reset countdowns.
- **Desktop widget** — a real WidgetKit widget (small / medium / large) in the
  system widget gallery.
- **Usage window** — the full breakdown in a normal window: resizable, remembers
  its position, and can float on top.
- **Live Claude service status** — a colored line in the menu and a dot on the
  ring when claude.ai, the API, Claude Code, or the Console has an incident.
- **Notifications** — 80% / 95% thresholds, reset alerts, "on pace to run out"
  warnings, and service up/down alerts. Each toggleable.
- **Global shortcut** (⌘⇧C) opens the window from anywhere — no extra permissions.
- **Configurable refresh** (15 s – 2 min), plus an instant refresh on wake.
- **No-Prompt Mode** — sign in to claude.ai once to stop the periodic macOS
  password prompt (see [below](#sign-in-and-the-password-prompt)).

## Sign-in and the password prompt

Out of the box the app uses your **Claude Code CLI** sign-in — nothing to set up.
The one quirk: because it reads a credential that belongs to the CLI, macOS asks
for your password to authorize it, and that authorization gets reset each time
the CLI refreshes its token (a few times a day). So the prompt comes back
periodically. This is macOS protecting the CLI's credential, not a bug.

**To never see that prompt,** turn on **No-Prompt Mode**, which signs in to
claude.ai and stores the session in a Keychain item the app owns:

> Menu → **No-Prompt Mode** → **Sign In to claude.ai…**

A sign-in window opens; log in once and you're done — no DevTools, no terminal.
The app switches over automatically and you can **Turn Off** any time from the
same menu to go back to CLI mode.

The claude.ai session is broader than the CLI token (full session access, sent
only to claude.ai) and expires every few weeks, at which point you sign in again.

<summary>Prefer to set the cookie by hand?</summary>

Run `./set-cookie.command` from a copy of this repo (it guides you through
copying the Cookie header), or do it directly: copy the `Cookie:` header from
claude.ai's DevTools (Network tab → the `usage` request) and run

```sh
security add-generic-password -U -s "Claudar-cookie" -a "claudar" -w "$(pbpaste)"
```

Remove it with `security delete-generic-password -s "Claudar-cookie"`.
